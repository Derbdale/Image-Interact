# Image Interact
Image Interact aims to provide a framework for creating and viewing interactive images.

## Compiling Instructions
To compile the source code into distributable code, you will need to run "tsc" in the project directory. You will also currently need to manually compile the SCSS.
In the future I will be using gulp to automate the project building.
